NOTE :
	Do we need a synchronous Javascript function for AnchorTag chasing, the page processing in
	JsLink.aspx is mostly asynchronous, except for document display without the HttpModule, 
	when that mode is active, the marking routine is synchronous so that the "click" wont
	fall through to the anchor tag before the mark happens

NOTE:
	The read unread field generates a JSLink url if the library is a supported type, for discussion 
	boards the JSLink is attached to the AllItems and Flat views. 
	The Threaded view uses thread.xsl and is an xsl view not a JSLInk view, we change that to our
	copy of Thread.xsl and add the JsLink infor into the template xls paramater reference is available
	at  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff806158(v=office.14).aspx
	
NOTE:
	According to online docs a SQL MERGE would have been a better logical choice for our Stored Procedure
	for Mark Read, however the quote is "Because the MERGE statement performs a full table scan of both the source and target tables"
	because of that I am very suspicious of performance
